# Pixel-Point-Processing-Webpage
A webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, showing the different pixel-point-processing techniques such as Increase Brightness. Decrease Brightness. Increasing Contrast. Decrease Contrast. Inverse (Negative of the Image). This supports only JPG and PNG image formats.

# Requirements
Implement decreasing brightness, increasing contrast, decreasing contrast and inverse functions (negative of an image) that will be applied on a grayscale image. 

# Techniques
## Increase Brightness:
Needs the field of “Increase Brightness Value” so that you can decrease the brightness of the image according to the given value as shown in the below graph.

## Decrease Brightness:
Needs the field of “Decrease Brightness Value” so that you can decrease the brightness of the image according to the given value as shown in the below graph.

## Increasing Contrast:
Needs the following fields so that you can increase the contrast of the image according to the given values as shown in the below graph.
- “Original Brightest Dark”
- “Original Darkest Bright”
- “Transformed Brightest Dark”
- “Transformed Darkest Bright”

## Decrease Contrast:
Needs the following fields so that you can decrease the contrast of the image according to the given values as shown in the below graph.

- “Original Brightest Dark”
- “Original Darkest Bright”
- “Transformed Brightest Dark”
- “Transformed Darkest Bright”

- **Note that:** You need to follow the naming here for labelling your input fields. Also, you have two grayscale images in the project folder that you can test on.
  
## Inverse (Negative of the Image):
Doesn’t need an input field and should apply the inverse of the image as shown in the below graph.
